# Organization of the repository and approach to testing
- Because environments are the key boundaries for testing, We will consider the environment as leading in the organization of the repository structure


Explanation:
- Environment-first approach makes it immediately clear where pipelines can run.
- Workflow-specific tests or unsupported configurations are grouped clearly beneath each environment.
- Clearer structure and consistent naming simplify navigation and reduce confusion.
