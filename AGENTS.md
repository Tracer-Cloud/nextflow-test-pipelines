# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Guide for Tracer Nextflow Test Pipelines

This guide provides standardized, actionable instructions for AI agents (e.g., OpenAI Codex) contributing to this repository of bioinformatics test pipelines. The project is organized by target system and environment manager to ensure reproducibility, maintainability, and ease of use.

---

## 1. Purpose and Placement

- This file (`AGENTS.md`) must remain in the repository root.
- It defines project structure, coding conventions, and testing protocols for all contributors and AI agents.

---

## 2. Project Structure: System-Based and Isolated Environments

- **Isolate Environments:**
  - Each folder under `pipelines/` represents a single, self-contained environment (e.g., `macos-arm64/nextflow-pixi/`, `linux-x86-ubuntu/nextflow-pixi/`).
  - Avoid cross-platform dependencies. Do not reference files or scripts outside the current environment folder, except for shared utilities in `pipelines/scripts/`.
  - This isolation reduces compatibility issues and debugging complexity.

```
pipelines/
├── macos-arm64/           # Apple Silicon (M1/M2) pipelines
│   └── nextflow-pixi/     # Pixi-managed Nextflow pipeline (self-contained)
├── linux-x86-ubuntu/      # Linux x86 (Ubuntu) pipelines
│   └── nextflow-pixi/
├── aws-batch/             # AWS Batch cloud execution
│   └── nextflow-pixi/
├── scripts/               # Shared utilities and helper scripts
└── ...
```

- **Test data** for each pipeline is in its own `test_data/` subfolder.
- Output, results, and work directories are auto-generated by Nextflow and should not be versioned.

---

## 3. Environment Management: Use Pixi

- **Standardize on Pixi:**
  - All new and existing pipeline examples must use [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) as the environment and dependency manager.
  - Each environment folder must include its own `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock` files.
  - Do not use Conda, Spack, or other managers for new examples.

---

## 4. Standardized Entry Point: start.sh

- **Entry Script:**
  - Every environment folder must include a `start.sh` script at its root.
  - `start.sh` is the default entry point and should:
    - Activate the Pixi environment (if needed)
    - Run the pipeline with minimal user input (ideally zero arguments for a default test run)
    - Print clear usage/help if run with `-h` or `--help`
  - Example:
    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    pixi run pipeline
    ```

---

## 5. CI/CD Validation: GitHub Actions

- **Workflow Validation:**
  - Every environment-specific pipeline must have a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.
  - The workflow should:
    - Set up Pixi
    - Install dependencies
    - Run `run.sh` and verify successful completion
    - Optionally, check for expected output files
  - Name the workflow file to match the environment (e.g., `macos-arm64, nextflow-pixi`).

---

## 6. Shared Utilities and Scripts

- **Centralize Common Logic:**
  - Place all shared setup logic, environment checks, and helper scripts in `pipelines/scripts/`.
  - Reference these scripts from `start.sh` or other scripts as needed, but do not duplicate logic across environment folders.
  - Example shared scripts: `check_env.sh`, `setup_java.sh`, `validate_output.sh`

---

## 7. Coding Conventions for Nextflow Pipelines

- **Workflow Language:** Use Nextflow (preferably DSL2) for all new pipelines.
- **Naming:**
  - Use descriptive, lowercase names for files and folders (e.g., `main.nf`, `custom.config`, `start.sh`).
  - Test data files should be clearly named (e.g., `sample1.fasta`).
- **Documentation:**
  - Every environment folder must have a `README.md` describing:
    - Purpose and expected inputs/outputs
    - How to run the pipeline (with example commands)
    - System/environment requirements
- **Resource Management:**
  - Specify CPU, memory, and time in each process block.
  - Use `errorStrategy` and `maxRetries` for robust execution.

---

## 8. Testing Protocols

- **Test Data:** Place minimal test data in each pipeline's `test_data/` directory.
- **How to Run Pipelines:**
  - **Local (Pixi/Conda):**
    ```bash
    # Example for Pixi
    cd pipelines/macos-arm64/nextflow-pixi
    pixi run pipeline
    # Or for Conda
    cd pipelines/linux-x86-ubuntu/nextflow-conda
    bash run.sh
    ```
  - **AWS Batch:**
    ```bash
    cd pipelines/aws-batch
    make test_rnaseq_aws_batch
    ```
- **Validation:** Pipelines must complete without error and produce expected output files in `results/` or `output/`.
- **Cleanup:** Use provided `clean` scripts/tasks to remove old results and logs.
- **CI/CD:** If automated tests are set up, all pipelines must pass before merging.
