## Usage

### Basic Version Check (Default)

```bash
nextflow run ../../shared/nextflow/main.nf -c ../../shared/nextflow/configs/basic.config
```

### FASTA Analysis with Conda

```bash
nextflow run ../../shared/nextflow/main.nf -c ../../shared/nextflow/configs/conda.config --workflow fasta_analysis
```

### FASTA Analysis with Pixi

```bash
nextflow run ../../shared/nextflow/main.nf -c ../../shared/nextflow/configs/pixi.config --workflow fasta_analysis
```

## Workflows

### Version Check Workflow

- Checks versions of common bioinformatics tools (FastQC, STAR, Samtools, BWA, GATK)
- Outputs results to `results/tool_versions.txt`

### FASTA Analysis Workflow

- Analyzes FASTA files for sequence statistics
- Counts sequences in FASTA files
- Checks versions of STAR and Salmon
- Outputs results to `results/fasta_stats/` and `results/counts/`

## Configurations

### Basic Config

- Simple configuration for tool version checking
- Minimal resource requirements
- Ignores errors to continue execution

### Conda Config

- Configured for conda environments
- Includes conda environment specification
- Higher resource requirements for FASTA analysis

### Pixi Config

- Configured for Pixi dependency management
- No conda environment needed
- Comprehensive logging and reporting
- Multiple execution profiles (standard, debug, fast)
